//save the file as name given to class contain main() method as in this code main() method is.
//in class c_01_helloworld that's why we used c_01_helloworld.java
//public is used to access the method outside the class.
//static is used because when the jvm execute the code it will class the main() using class c_01_helloworld without creating object.
//i.e jvm  ->  c_01_helloworld.main()
//void is used as main() is not returning nothing.
// main is method name from which the execution of code is started.
// String[] args is the command line argument which are pass during exection/interpreting the code.
//System.out.println() is used to display the parameter pass in it on the monitor.


//code.
